================================ FastFlat: Your Ultimate Rental Platform ================================

NB! Since we have already established a viable database, there is no need to perform any migrations and database updates before launching the project.
NB! We have also implemented a private API key that is to be shared nor used by ANYONE for anything outside of this project. This implementation is for
educational purposes only and is scheduled for deleted upon grading.
